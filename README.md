## 1 Introduction

**Monkey** interpreter language which is implemented Go language. After typing `monkey` in terminal, you get into the `monkey` programming language.

```shell
$ GO111MODULE=on go build
$ ./monkey
Hello $Username! This is Monkey programming language!
Feel free to type in commnd
Enter "exit()" or CTRL+C to quit command interface
>>>
```

## 2 Syntax

### 2.1 Definition

using `let` as keyword, each line ends with `;`.

```monkey
>>>let a = 3;
>>>let b = 1;
>>>a+b
4
```

### 2.2 Arithmetic operations

`monkey` supports all basic arithmetic operation of `int`. `int` type is represented by `int64`.

```monkey
>>> let a = 3;
>>> let b = 1;
>>> a + b
4
>>> a - b
2
>>> a * b
4
>>> a / b
3
```

### 2.3 Builtin containers

`monkey` contains two builtin containers: `array` and `map`.

- array

array is a list which organizes items by linear sequence. But types of items can be different from each other.

```monkey
>>> let a = [1, 2.3, "array"];
>>> a
[1, 2.3, array]
>>> let b = push(a, "another");
>>> b
[1, 2.3, array, another]
```

- map

map is treated as `key-value` container. please attention to that only `boolean`, `int` and `string` types can be used as key.

```monkey
>>> let a = {"name":"moneky", true:1, 7:"sevent"};
>>> a
{name: monkey, true: 1, 7: seven}
>>> a["name"]
monkey
>>> a[true]
1
>> a[7]
seven
>>>let b = set(a, 8, "eight");
>>> b
{name: moneky, true: 1, 7: sevent, 8: eight}
```

### 2.4 Builtin functions

- `len`

yield the length of builtin containers.

- `first`

yield the first element of array.

- `last`

yield the last element of array.

- `rest`

yield an array which excludes the first element.

- `push`

push an elements into the array.

- `set`

insert key value pair into the map

- `puts`

print literal value of objects.

### 2.5 Function

`monkey` use `fn` as the definition of function. Apart from regular function using, `monkey` also includes high order function.

```monkey
>>>let add = fn(a, b) { return a + b;};
>>> add(1,2)
3
>>>let addTwo = fn(a,b, f) { return 2 + f(a, b);};
>>>addTwo(1,2, add)
5
```

### 2.5 If-else statements

`monkey` supports if-else statements.

```monkey
>>> let max = fn(a, b) { if (a > b) { return a;} else { return b; } };
>>> max(1, 2)
2
```

### 2.6 For-loop statements

`monkey` support for-loop statement.

```monkey
>>> let sum = fn(x) { let i = 1; let sum = 0; for (i < x) { let sum = sum + i; let i = i+1; } return sum; };
>>> sum(100)
4950
```
